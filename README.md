I think graceful degredation and service workers are similar becasue they are like a failsafe when things go wrong. Graceful degredation is more all encompenssing and helps make sure that an application still works even if certain parts of it arent working. Similarily service workers can help a browser when there is an error with internet connection like how we used them in this lab.
